## CMU X Turn The Bus
This repository contains the code for the lab simulation part of the virtual physics lab developed by METALS (Masters in Educational Technology and Applied Learning Sciences) students at Carnegie Mellon University in collaboration with Turn The Bus. The entire physics lab is divided into 2 parts -

* Instructional Content - Instructional Content (this repo)
* Lab Simulation - [Lab Simulation](https://github.com/Dhruvisha01/Capstone-MVPThreeLab)
